# x86-Number-Guessing-Game
This program is a simple number guessing game written in x86 Assembly for a DOS environment. User 1 enters a secret two-digit number, which is split into tens and units digits and combined to form the full number. User 2 guesses the number by entering their own two digits. After each guess, the program provides feedback (too high or too low) until User 2 guesses correctly. Once the correct guess is made, the game ends with a win message. The program demonstrates basic low-level programming concepts, using DOS interrupts for input/output and simple arithmetic for comparison.
